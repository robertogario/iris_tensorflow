# iris_tensorflow
A python script to classify Iris flower data.

The script downloads data from an online machine learning database, in CSV format.

It trains a perceptron network using the data and then uses the trained network to classify test data.

At present it typically achieves around 97% accuracy in classifying the flowers.
